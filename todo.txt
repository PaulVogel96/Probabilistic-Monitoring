- finish basic properties
- unit test basic properties
- Implement multiple instances property checking
- write basic sender .ino's for basic properties
- Benchmark speed of basic properties
- Multi-Channel property viewpoint
- develop an idea how to write benchmarks
- investigate AbsenceBeforeRProperty_satisfied_when_no_P_or_R Test (shouldn't low probability transitions fire?)
