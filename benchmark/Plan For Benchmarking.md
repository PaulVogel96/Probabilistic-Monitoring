# Plan for Benchmarking

1. Check Property state behavior -> on trigger revert to initial state
2. Implement binary decision making
3. Run clean runs with no missing data to prove spec equivalence
4. Run runs with missingness
5. Compare output with ground truths
6. Metrics (precision, recall, F1, IoU)
