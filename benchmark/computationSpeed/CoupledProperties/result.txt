Benchmarks for calculation speed:
- Ran on an Arduino Mega 2560
- 4 Coupled properties with probabilistic transitions
- coupled_blocking_missing_seed2025_mr0_1_L_3 trace

simple run, calculate violation per property:
13:05:00:990 -> start
13:05:07:060 -> stop

diff: 6.070s

print violations per property and timestamp
13:15:27:669 -> start
13:15:48:459 -> stop

diff: 20.790s

Interpretation:
- We can calculate violations super fast, with ~593 events caclulated per second
- printing over the Serial costs time
